You need to use input property to make use of property binding.

First, you need to import the decorator function from angular/core
-  import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';

Second, you can now use the input decorator in your field.
e.g.
@Input() isFavorite: boolean = false;

NOTE: @Input() is another decorator in angular for marking fields and properties as input properties.

With the code above, that field is exposed to the outside, and in your template you can bind it to a property.
e.g.
<app-favorite [isFavorite]='post.isFavorite'></app-favorite>

NOTE: the [isFavorite] if and input field coming from the favorite component and the
post.isFavorite if coming from the database.
