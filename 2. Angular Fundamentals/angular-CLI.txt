In your terminal, you can generate a component using angular CLI
----- COMPONENT -----
syntax:
LONG WAY: ng generate component product
SHORT WAY: ng g c product
NOTE: you can put --dry-run to tell the Angular CLI to only show what files would have been generated when running the commands.
e.g.
ng g c product --dry-run

It will add a directory/folder, and in that folder it will add four(4) files.
e.g.
create src/app/product/product.component.css
create src/app/product/product.component.html
create src/app/product/product.component.spec.ts
create src/app/product/product.component.ts
update src/app/app.module

NOTE: as you can see, it also updated the app.module and registered your component automatically.


----- SERVICE -----
syntax:
LONG WAY: ng generate service product
SHORT WAY: ng g s product

Files that will be generated:
e.g.
create src/app/product.service.spec.ts
create src/app/product.service.ts
