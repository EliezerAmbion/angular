In Angular there is a concept called event filtering.
EVENT FILTERING - is when you can use the properties of an event.

----- TRADITIONAL WAY -----
e.g.
<input (keyup)="onKeyUp($event)" />

In your method:
export class SampleComponent {
  onKeyUp($event){
    if($event.keyCode === 13) console.log('ENTER was pressed'); // 13 is the key code for enter
  }
}

In angular there is a better way in handling an event.
----- ANGULAR WAY -----
e.g.
<input (keyup.enter)="onKeyUp()" /> // .enter is EVENT FILTERING

- In keyup event, you can add the (.enter). The onKeyUp method will be called only if you press enter.
OPTIONAL: You don't have to pass the $event object anymore.

In your method:
export class SampleComponent {
  onKeyUp(){
    console.log('ENTER was pressed');
}

As you can see, the second example is much cleaner.
