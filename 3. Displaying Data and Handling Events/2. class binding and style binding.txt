There are times that you want to add additional classes to an element based on some condition.
For example you want to add a class on a button based on the state of the underlying component.

e.g.
isActive = true;
<button [class.active]="isActive">Save<button>

NOTE: If the condition evaluates to true, the class will be added to the element.


----- STYLE BINDING -----
e.g.
<button [style.backgroundColor]="isActive ? 'blue' : 'white'">Save<button>
NOTE: blue and white are in single quotes.
