DOM is a model of objects that represent the structure of a document. It's essentially a tree of objects in memory.
HTML is a markup language that we use to represent DOM in text.

So when your browser parses an HTML document, it creates a tree of objects in memory that they refer to as the DOM.
You can also use other languages like vanilla javascript to create a DOM but using html is far more simpler.

NOTE: Most of the attributes of HTML elements have a one-to-one mapping for properties of DOM objects. But, there are a few exceptions.
For example we have HTML attributes that don't have a representation in the DOM.
colspan is an example of that. So when we parse the HTML markup, and create an actual DOM object for td. <td [colspan]="sample">, that DOM object does not have a property called colspan, then you will get an error.

There are also properties in DOM that do not have a representation in HTML. e.g. <h1 [textContent]="sample">

REMEMBER: When using property binding, you should remember that you are actually binding property of a DOM object and NOT an attribute of an HTML element.
