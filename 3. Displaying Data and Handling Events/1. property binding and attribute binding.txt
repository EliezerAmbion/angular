Property Binding - it binds a Property of a DOM element, like src, to a field where property in your component. 
- If the value of the field (instance variable) changes, the view gets notified and automatically updated.

Attribute Binding - it binds an attribute of an HTML element, like colspan, to a field where property in your component.
- They are used to transfer data from SOURCE to the VIEW, and when something changes in the SOURCE, the VIEW or the DOM gets notified and also changes.

NOTE: it only works one way - from component to the DOM/VIEW.

e.g. of property binding
<input [value]="newPost"></input>
- You have bound the value property using property binding.

e.g. of attribute binding
<td [attr.colspan]="sample"></td>
- When using attribute binding, you need to prefix this attribute with attr which is short for attribute.
