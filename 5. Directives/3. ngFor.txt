COMPLETE CODE:

in .ts:
export class AppComponent {
  courses = [
    { id: 1, name: 'course1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'course2' },
    { id: 3, name: 'course3' },
  ]
}

in HTML:

<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let course of courses>
    {{ course.name }}
  </li>
</ul>

This ngFor directive exports a lot of values that might help you build certain features. 
For example imagine you want to render a table, and you want to highlight the first row, or maybe you want to highlight
the last row, or you want to highlight the odd or even rows. Or maybe you want to display an index next to each object.
We can use the exported values from ngFor directive. 

One of the exported values is called index.
e.g.
<li *ngFor="let course of courses; index as i>
  {{ i }} - {{ course.name }}
</li>

NOTE: you can find all the exported values in angular.io website and search for ngForOf.
