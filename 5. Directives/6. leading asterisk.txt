When we use the leading asterisk with our structural directives, like ngIf, ngFor, and ngSwitchCase, 
Angular is going to rewrite that block using an ng template. 
Now obviously you can do this yourself, but it's much easier to use the leading asterisk and let Angular do the hard work.

When we use the leading asterisk on ngIf, you're telling Angular to rewrite the markup, 
rewrite the block using an ng-template element.

e.g.

<div *ngIf="courses.length > 0; else noCourses">
  List of Courses
</div>

With the code above, using a leading asterisk, Angular will rewrite it like this:

<ng-template [ngIf]="courses.length > 0">
  <div>
    List of Courses
  </div>
</ng-template>

<ng-template [ngIf]="!(courses.length > 0)">
  <div>
    List of Courses
  </div>
</ng-template>

NOTE: Angular will going to apply ngIf as property binding on the ng-template.
