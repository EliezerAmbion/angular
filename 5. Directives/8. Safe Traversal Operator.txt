Now sometimes when you are dealing with complex objects it is possible that the value of a property may be known or undefined for a certain period of time. For example you might want to call different endpoints to get these objects from the server so then assignee might be null for a fraction of a second.

There are two solution here, either use ngIf:

<span *ngIf="task.assignee">{{ task.assignee.name }}</span>

OR, use the SAFE TRAVERSAL OPERATOR:

<span *ngIf>{{ task.assignee?.name }}</span>

NOTE: the usage is putting a question mark. see above.

DIFFERENCE between ngIf and safe traversal operator:

ngIf - will remove the DOM element.
Safe traversal - DOM element will be kept, the value will not be render.
