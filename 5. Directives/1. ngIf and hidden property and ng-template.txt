COMPLETE CODE:

<div *ngIf="courses.length > 0; then coursesList else noCourses"></div>
<ng-template #coursesList>
  LIST OF COURSES
</ng-template>

<ng-template #noCourses>
  NO COURSES YET
</ng-template>

NOTE: when using template variables, you don't have to put #. e.g. in line num 3

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HIDDEN PROPERTY:
the hidden attribute in HTML also exists as a property in your DOM objects, so you can use property binding.
e.g.

<div [hidden]="courses.length > 0">
  LIST OF COURSES
</div>

<div [hidden]="courses.length == 0">
  NO COURSES YET
</div>

NOTE: both divs will exist in your DOM even if the first condition or the second condition is truthy.
NOTE: the main difference between using *ngIf and the hidden property is that when you use ngIf on an element, 
if the condition evaluates to falsey, that element is removed from the DOM. When you use the hidden attribute, the 
element is in the DOM, it is just hidden.
